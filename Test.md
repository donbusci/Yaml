**This is an early beta. There are issues. Elements CMS is a work-in-progress.**

We've purposely stripped this down to the bare minimum - just three CMS components: **Collection**, **Item**, and **Load More**. This lets us iron out the core bugs before adding complexity.

## Important Notes

**Not production ready.** Use this beta for testing and feedback only. We're building quality over quantity - getting the foundation right before adding advanced features.

**Your feedback matters.** Please [post thoughts and bug reports on the forum](https://forums.realmacsoftware.com/). This beta phase directly influences how Elements CMS evolves.

## What's Coming Next

This preview gives you a taste of the future. Here's what we're building:

**Content & Performance:**

• Caching for lightning-fast sites

• Pagination for better performance

• Search functionality

• Filter support

**Organization:**

• Tag Listings

• Author Listings  

• Conditionals for dynamic content

• Related Items suggestions

**Media:**

• Gallery Support with automatic image handling

## Known Issues

**Lists don't work yet!** We need to add support for lists in the Typography component. It's coming soon.

*Remember: This is a beta. Expect issues, and help us build something amazing.*
